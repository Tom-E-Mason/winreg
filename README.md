# winreg
Modern C++ API for Windows registry operations.

## acknowledgements
This project is inspired by similar projects by [m4x1m1l14n](https://github.com/m4x1m1l14n/Registry) and [GiovanniDicanio](https://github.com/GiovanniDicanio/WinReg). I am mostly trying to learn about the Windows Registry and designing APIs with this project but if anyone finds this toolkit useful that's a bonus.
